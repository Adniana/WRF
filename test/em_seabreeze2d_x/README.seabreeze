The purpose of this case is to demonstrate how one can set up all land variables
in order to ues fullphysics option in an idealized case. 

This test case is an attempt to produce a two dimensional sea breeze simulation.
Configuration needs turning to produce desirable results. 

The input sounding has a easterly wind of 11.4 m/sec at 125 m above sea level,
and decreases to 0 at 2.6 km.

The setup for a 2D case with 202 grid points in x. The land occupies 50 grid
points in the middle of the domain. The width of the land can be changed
by modifying variable lm (half width for land points) in 
dyn_em/module_initialize_seabreeze2d_x.F.
